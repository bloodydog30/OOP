Proposal Plan

Student number – C11385741
I am a big fan of the classic arcade game “Asteroid”. So my proposed plan for the second semester assignment is to do 
my own variation of this game with added features. The goal of the game is to survive as long as you can with asteroid 
coming at the player in all direction. The asteroid will speed up slowly if it does not collide with anything and it will
slow down if it does. There will be three asteroid types large, medium and small, each with different health and player
must either break or dodge the asteroid. If the health falls to zero it will break apart or destroyed. Few of the extra
elements I have in mind is aliens chasing the player around and maybe a boss or some sort once the player reaches a 
certain scores. Also random power ups or extra health as items randomly generated on the map which player can get 
to boost the spaceship.

Some of the added features that I had brain-stormed so far are a menu system, scores system, game-play with music, 
pause and resume, monsters randomly spawning to attack the player and power ups of some sort. There will more to be
added and implemented if there is any time left over before it is due.

Some of the proposed tested to test this program is to do stages testing along the way as I am implementing each of 
the features or functionality of the game. I am also thinking getting a few friends to test the game out and see if
they would encounter any errors or glitch inside the game.
